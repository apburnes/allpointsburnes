There is nothing worse than sitting at a red light on a quiet street with no one around.
It's much better to travel a nice controlled flow instead of the
stop go where people speed to the next stop. Roundabouts have become increasingly popular in urban planning for their
ability to improve traffic flow, enhance pedestrian safety, and reduce long-term
maintenance costs compared to traditional signalized intersections.
But identifying which intersections are good candidates for conversion requires analyzing road networks, traffic patterns, and infrastructure data.

I recently built a Python-based analysis tool using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) data to identify intersections in the Phoenix metro area where two two-lane roads meet with traffic signals—prime candidates for roundabout conversion. This post walks through the problem, the iterative development process, and the challenges we encountered along the way.

## The Problem

The goal was straightforward: find all intersections in Phoenix where:

1. Two two-lane roads intersect
2. There is a traffic signal at the intersection
3. The intersection could potentially benefit from roundabout conversion

This analysis would help urban planners and transportation engineers
prioritize intersection improvements based on infrastructure characteristics
rather than just traffic volume data.

## Visualizing the Results

Let's not bury the lead. I've mapped out all of
the identified intersections that could be ideal candidates for conversion
and see what you think about this analysis with OpenStreetMap data. It came up with 256
possible intersections for that could be ideal for a roundabout.

## Initial Approach

I started by querying OSM data via the [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) to:

- Extract all roads with lane information
- Filter to two-lane roads
- Find intersections where two two-lane roads meet
- Identify which intersections have traffic signals
- Select signaled intersections that intersect with two-lane roads.

The initial implementation used Python with `overpy` for Overpass queries, `shapely` for geometric operations, and `geopandas` for spatial analysis. The workflow seemed simple enough: query roads, filter, find intersections, filter by signals, analyze.

## Problems Encountered

### Rate Limiting and Server Load

The first major issue was hitting Overpass API rate limits. When querying large areas like the Phoenix metro region,
the API would return "Server load too high" errors. This required implementing retry logic with exponential backoff:

### Two-Lane Road Identification

Identifying two-lane roads in OSM proved more complex than expected.
OSM data completeness varies, lane information can be tagged in multiple ways,
and intersections can end up having more than two lanes. Think of a right and/or left
turn lane just at the intersection. If you were to convert the intersection from a
traffic signal to a roundabout, these turn lanes would become obsolete.

The road line segment properties consists of four relevant fields:

- `highway`: The type of road like `residential`, `tertiary`, `service`, etc.
- `lanes`: The total number of lanes on the road.
- `lanes:forward`: The total number lanes traveling in the forward direction
- `lanes:backward`: The total number of lanes traveling in the opposite direction

To identify road segments that meet my two-lane road criteria, I looked for the following:

- Ignore any road segment with type `highway` equal to `service`. This means it is a road on private property. Like parking lots or driveway entrances
- The road segment had a total of two lanes
- If a road segment had a total of three or four lanes
  - Take the difference between the `lanes` and `lanes:forward` and the difference between the `lanes:backward`
  - If either of differences equal one, consider it a two-lane road.

### Spatial Accuracy for Signal Detection

Initially, we matched traffic signals to intersections by node ID. However, traffic signals in OSM aren't always tagged at the exact intersection node—they might be slightly offset. We improved accuracy by:

1. Creating a 2-meter buffer around each traffic signal
2. Checking which two-lane road LineStrings intersect with the buffer
3. Only including signals that intersect with 3 or more roads (indicating a true intersection)

### Processing Large Areas

Querying the entire Phoenix metro area in one request was too large and would timeout. We solved this by breaking the bounding box into 2-mile square chunks:

This chunking approach allowed us to:

- Process each area independently
- Save the chunk to GeoJSON for final aggregation
- Handle failures gracefully (one chunk failing doesn't stop the entire analysis)
- Distribute processing over time to respect API rate limits
- Make the analysis more parallelizable in the future

## Final Solution

The refined workflow processes for the area of interest:

1. Breakdown the area of interest into smaller, manageable chunks
1. Query roads for the chunk
1. Filter to two-lane roads using refined logic
1. Query traffic signals for the chunk
1. Spatially filter signals that intersect with two-lane roads (using a 2m buffer)
1. Aggregate results from all chunks
1. Deduplicate traffic singles by id
1. Save the final results to GeoJSON

This approach is more robust, handles large areas efficiently, and produces higher-quality results by using spatial queries rather than simple node matching.

## Next Steps

The analysis tool outputs GeoJSON files with all identified intersections, which can be:

- Combined with traffic volume data to prioritize conversions
- Used for cost-benefit analysis of roundabout projects
- Integrated into transportation planning workflows

The [code is available](https://github.com/apburnes/allpointsburnes/tree/main/apps/roundabout-intersections) in the project repository
and can be adapted for other metropolitan areas or modified to include additional filtering criteria like proximity to schools, hospitals, or other high-priority locations.
